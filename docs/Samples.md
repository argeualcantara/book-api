# Book System API - Sample Documentation

This documentation provides sample code snippets demonstrating how to interact with the Book System API to manage books effectively.

## Listing All Books

To retrieve a list of all books available in the system, send a GET request to the `/books` endpoint.

### Example (using Python requests library):

```python
import requests

base_url = 'https://api.booksystem.com/v1'

# List all books
url = f'{base_url}/books'
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    books = response.json()
    print('List of Books:', books)
else:
    print('Failed to retrieve books:', response.text)
```

## Getting Details of a Specific Book

To retrieve details of a specific book by its ID, send a GET request to the `/books/{id}` endpoint.

### Example (using Python requests library):

```python
import requests

base_url = 'https://api.booksystem.com/v1'
book_id = '<BOOK_ID_TO_RETRIEVE>'

# Get details of a specific book
url = f'{base_url}/books/{book_id}'
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    book_details = response.json()
    print('Book Details:', book_details)
else:
    print('Failed to retrieve book details:', response.text)
```

## Adding a New Book

To add a new book to the system, send a POST request to the `/books` endpoint with the book details in the request body.

### Example (using Python requests library):

```python
import requests

base_url = 'https://api.booksystem.com/v1'

# Add a new book
url = f'{base_url}/books'
data = {
    'title': 'New Book',
    'author': 'John Doe',
    'category': 'Fiction',
    'synopsis': 'Synopsis of the new book',
    'publication_year': 2022,
    'publisher': 'Publisher Name'
    # Additional book details...
}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print('New book added successfully.')
else:
    print('Failed to add new book:', response.text)
```

## Conclusion

These sample code snippets demonstrate how to use the Book System API to manage books effectively, including listing all books, retrieving details of a specific book, and adding a new book to the system. By following these examples, you can integrate the Book System API into your application and manage your book collection seamlessly.
